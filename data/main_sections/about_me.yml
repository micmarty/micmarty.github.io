title: About me

parts:
  - |
    I'm a Software Engineer with a <b>very generic</b> dream: to work on some impressive technology that could be perceived by other people as truly fascinating, e.g.
    <ul>
      <li>self-driving cars,</li>
      <li>voice assistants</li>
    </ul>
    Even though I'm willing to stay close to Deep Learning domain, leveling up my leadership skills is gradually becoming more and more important to me. 
    <br><br>
    I consider myself as a person with quite wide knowledge, who tries to follow all the breakthroughs of the AI world, day-to-day just for fun.

#  especially in NLP (language modelling, voice/chatbots)
